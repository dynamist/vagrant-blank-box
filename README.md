# Vagrant blank box

An empty box to test PXE booting over the network, or booting from local ISO files. And possibly attach USB devices, or allocate some storage on local attached disks.

Our goal is to have a virtual box with 2 vCPU, 2 GB RAM, 2x CD/DVD ROM drives, 4x network adapters, 4x storage devices, and an enabled USB controller. The boot order should be:

- Network
- Removable devices
- CD-ROM drive
- Hard drive

The hardware should be compatible with Linux 3.x, which is good as far back as CentOS 7 and Ubuntu 16.04.


## VMware Workstation Pro

The lowest common version that supports these features is Workstation 14.x (compatible with ESX1 6.7 and Fusion 10.x)

- NVMe devices
- UEFI Secure Boot
- Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
- I/O MMU virtualization

<!--
IOMMU is a component in a memory controller that translates device virtual addresses into physical addresses.

The IOMMUâ€™s DMA re-mapping functionality is necessary in order for VMDirectPath I/O to work. DMA transactions sent by the passthrough PCI function carry guest OS physical addresses which must be translated into host physical addresses by the IOMMU.

Hardware-assisted I/O MMU virtualization called Intel Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O (VT-d) in Intel processors and AMD I/O Virtualization (AMD-Vi or IOMMU) in AMD processors, is an I/O memory management feature that remaps I/O DMA transfers and device interrupts. This feature (strictly speaking, is a function of the chipset, rather than the CPU) can allow virtual machines to have direct access to hardware I/O devices, such as network cards, storage controllers (HBAs), and GPUs.

The contents of the Vagrant box is documented in https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/providers/vmware/boxes#contents

> The files that are strictly required for a VMware machine to function are: nvram, vmsd, vmx, vmxf, and vmdk files.
>
> There is also the "metadata.json" file used by Vagrant itself.

Once we have created a suitable virtual machine in VMware Workstation we have:

```
blank-disk1.vmdk
blank-disk2.vmdk
blank-disk3.vmdk
blank-disk4.vmdk
blank.vmsd
blank.vmx
blank.vmxf
blank.vmx.lck
```

Notably missing is the nvram file but it seems that we do without it. We will also skip the lck directory.
